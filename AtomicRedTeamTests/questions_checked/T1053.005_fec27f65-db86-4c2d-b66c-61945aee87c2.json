    "context": "An adversary attempted persistence on a Windows host by registering tasks that execute an application at user logon and system startup.",
    "objective": "Determine which native Windows utility was leveraged to create these scheduled tasks.",

        "command_analysis": "The attacker ran a command-line tool with parameters to create tasks named T1053_005_OnLogon and T1053_005_OnStartup, pointing to cmd.exe.",
