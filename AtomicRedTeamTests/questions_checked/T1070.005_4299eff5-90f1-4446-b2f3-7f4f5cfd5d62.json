    "context": "In a Windows environment, hidden administrative shares provide remote access to disk volumes. An attacker may remove these shares using built-in commands to hide their presence.",
    "objective": "Determine which default administrative share names were deleted via the command prompt on the Windows host.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attacker ran commands of the form ‘net share <ShareName> /delete’ to remove administrative shares.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: Each expected answer (\"C$\", \"IPC$\", \"ADMIN$\") appears as a value under the 'DeletedShare' column in the query results. This matches exactly with the information needed to detect deletions of these specific administrative shares. The surrounding columns provide context (timestamp, affected device, user account, and the command line used), which contributes to the evidence. The results are well-structured to answer the detection question.",
