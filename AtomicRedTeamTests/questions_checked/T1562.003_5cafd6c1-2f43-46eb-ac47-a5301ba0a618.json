    "context": "On a monitored Linux host, an adversary manipulated the shell environment to disable command logging by adjusting HISTFILESIZE. Logs capture process execution details but no direct indicators flag this change.",
    "objective": "Detect when the HISTFILESIZE variable was reassigned to suppress bash history and determine the new value set.",

        "command_analysis": "The attacker executed a bash export command to set HISTFILESIZE to zero.",

The additional fields ('TimeGenerated', 'DeviceName', 'InitiatingProcessAccountName', 'ProcessCommandLine') provide context, but most importantly, the presence of '0' in the 'NewHistSize' field for each result directly answers the detection question as described in the expected answers.",
