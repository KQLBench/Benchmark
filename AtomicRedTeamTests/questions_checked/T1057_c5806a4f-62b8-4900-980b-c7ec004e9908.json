    "context": "An adversary on a Windows host leveraged built-in utilities to enumerate running processes as part of their reconnaissance.",
    "objective": "Identify when and how the Windows tasklist command was executed via the command prompt.",

        "command_analysis": "The attacker used cmd.exe to invoke a native process enumeration tool rather than a custom binary.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask which native Windows tool was executed for process discovery; the answer is the exact command name.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: All returned rows have 'tasklist.exe' as the FileName and 'tasklist' in the ProcessCommandLine. The command lines make it clear that the 'tasklist' command was invoked, matching the expected answers.
