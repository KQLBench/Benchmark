        "command_analysis": "The test runs two PowerShell cmdlets: one to list all local groups and another to enumerate members of a specific group via the '-Name' parameter.",

The row ['\\\"\"Administrators\"\\\"', 3] shows that 'Administrators' is present as a group name (despite the extra quoting), aligning with the expected answer 'Administrators'.
