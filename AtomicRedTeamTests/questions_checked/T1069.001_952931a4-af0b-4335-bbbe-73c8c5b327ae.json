    "context": "An attacker on a Linux host chained several local utilities to enumerate all permission groups and membership information, potentially to map user roles.",
    "objective": "Detect which native utility was invoked to query the system’s group database entries.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The adversary executed a series of commands including dscacheutil, dscl, groups, id, getent, and directly read /etc/group to enumerate local group information.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Phrase the question to focus on identifying a specific utility used among many, and expect a single-word answer matching the command name.",
    "prompt": "On a Linux endpoint, process events reveal a chain of group‐enumeration utilities executed by a single session. Which utility was used to query the system’s group database?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The results include a list of utilities and their invocation counts. 'getent' appears with a count of 3, which aligns with the expected answer. The presence of 'getent' in the results confirms that the query output contains the necessary information to answer the detection question regarding its usage.",
