We look for events where the initiating process command line contains the term 'tor' and the keyword 'start', which is typical when launching the Tor service. \n\nStep 3: Finally, we project the TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName and InitiatingProcessCommandLine to help identify and analyze the command that started the service.\n\nThis query is designed to be run within a specified timerange, and you can adjust the search string as needed.",
