    "context": "On Windows endpoints, an adversary may clear the system recycle bin to hide traces, invoking built-in directory removal commands.",

    "prompt": "Suspiciously, the recycle bin appears empty system-wide. Determine which command was executed on Windows to clear the system's recycle bin directory, including any switches and environment variables.",

The structure of the results includes relevant context (timestamp, device, account, and process command line) and directly contains the expected activity. Therefore, the query results can be used to answer the detection question.",
