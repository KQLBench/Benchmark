    "context": "On Windows hosts, adversaries may delete backup files en masse to disrupt recovery, resembling ransomware cleanup activity. Logs will show a process deletion command targeting multiple backup extensions under the C: drive.",
    "objective": "Discover the exact command line executed to remove various backup file types from the C: drive.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "Search process creation records for the Windows 'del' utility invoked with switches and multiple file patterns (e.g., .VHD, .bak, .bkf, etc.).",
        "detection_approach": "Use KQL against DeviceProcessEvents to filter on ProcessCommandLine containing 'del' and typical backup file extensions under C:\\, then extract the full command line."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "We need a question that leads the analyst to search process events for a bulk deletion of backup files, and to report back the exact command string that was logged.",
    "prompt": "An attacker obtained elevated rights on a Windows system and ran a deletion command that attempted to remove various backup file types across the C: drive, generating numerous “access denied” errors. What was the full command line used?",
