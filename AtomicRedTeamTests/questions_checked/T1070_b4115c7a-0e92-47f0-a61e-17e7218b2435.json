The query result contains two relevant ProcessCommandLine entries: 'fsutil  usn deletejournal /D C:' and '\"cmd.exe\" /c fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:'. Both show evidence of the target command being executed (with and without quoting and extra spaces), meeting the requirement to detect this activity. The differences in double backslash and quoting are trivial, and the detection logic should recognize these as matching the expected command usage.",
