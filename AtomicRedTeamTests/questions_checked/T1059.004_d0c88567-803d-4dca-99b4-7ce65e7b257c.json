        "command_analysis": "Attackers frequently use curl or wget with a URL piped into bash to retrieve and run scripts in one step. Look for command lines containing these utilities alongside a pipe to a shell.",

This URL corresponds to the script 'echo-art-fish.sh', which is explicitly named in the expected answers.
