    "context": "A Linux environment where process execution logs capture command-line invocations of common utilities.",
    "objective": "Detect misuse of awk’s BEGIN rule to spawn an interactive shell and break out of restricted environments.",

        "command_analysis": "The attacker invokes awk with a BEGIN block that calls system to launch /bin/sh in the background.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Focus on process execution logs, filter for awk, and inspect the full command-line arguments. The question requires extracting the exact invocation that spawned the shell.",
    "prompt": "On a Linux system, find any process creation record where awk is used with a BEGIN rule to launch a shell. What was the exact command invoked?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is the specific awk command: awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/sh &\")}\u00199. The query results include multiple instances where the ProcessCommandLine field matches or closely resembles this command (e.g., 'awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/sh &\")}', 'sh -c 'awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/sh &\")}''). Additionally, the relevant fields such as TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, and ProcessId are present, confirming that the detected activity matches the expected answer.
