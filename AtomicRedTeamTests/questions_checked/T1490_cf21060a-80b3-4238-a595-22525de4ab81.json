    "context": "On Windows hosts, attackers may disable the Windows Recovery Console at boot to prevent system repair and hinder incident response. Recent telemetry suggests the built-in BCDEdit utility was used to alter boot recovery settings.",

        "command_analysis": "The attacker used bcdedit.exe with the \"/set {default} recoveryenabled no\" parameter to turn off recovery. This appears as a second invocation following an initial bootstatuspolicy modification.",
