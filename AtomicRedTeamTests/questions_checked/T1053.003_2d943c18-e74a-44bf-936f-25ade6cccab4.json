    "context": "On Linux servers, attackers often gain persistence by dropping scripts into system cron directories. In particular, a malicious actor might append a new file under /var/spool/cron/crontabs to schedule tasks.",
    "objective": "Identify when a new script file is created in the /var/spool/cron/crontabs folder on Linux endpoints.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "A bash command running with elevated privileges appends content into /var/spool/cron/crontabs/<script_name>, creating or modifying that file.",
        "detection_approach": "Search file creation or modification events (e.g., Syslog or DeviceFileEvents) for actions targeting the /var/spool/cron/crontabs folder and inspect the file name involved."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Ask directly for the name of the script file that appeared in the crontabs directory, yielding a single-word answer.",
    "prompt": "Linux hosts may log events when new files are added to /var/spool/cron/crontabs. Query those logs for a creation or write action in that directory and determine the file name that was added.",
