    "context": "Adversaries on Linux sometimes use standard utilities to introduce execution delays, for example leveraging ping with a high packet count before running their payload.",

        "command_analysis": "Look for a process event invoking 'ping -c <high_count> 8.8.8.8' followed by a second process event spawned by the same session or parent that runs an unexpected command.",
        "detection_approach": "Correlate consecutive DeviceProcessEvents for the same session or parent: first a ping with a large '-c' argument, then another process soon after. Extract the second command's full invocation."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Formulate a question that points to chained process events (delay via ping then payload) and asks specifically for the follow-up command string.",
