    "context": "On Linux endpoints, attackers may leverage the native shred utility to securely overwrite and then delete files, leaving minimal recoverable artifacts.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer 'victim-shred.txt' is present (with a '/tmp/' path prefix) in the 'ShreddedFile' field of the query results. Each result row shows an event involving the shredding of '/tmp/victim-shred.txt'. This provides direct evidence to answer the detection question about activities relating to 'victim-shred.txt'. The rows are structured with sufficient detail (including time, device, user, process, and file name) to support this determination.",
