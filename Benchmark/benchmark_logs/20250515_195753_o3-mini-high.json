            "explanation": "This KQL query finds events where a Linux script was generated by decoding a base64 encoded file and then executed. The query creates two subsets from the DeviceProcessEvents table: one for decoding events where the initiating command line includes 'base64', '-d', and a redirection operator '>', and another for execution events where the FileName ends with .sh. The command line is parsed using a regex to extract the decoded file name (which should be a .sh script). We then join the decoding and execution events on DeviceId and ensure that the execution occurred after the decoding event. A further filter uses a trimmed version of the decoded file name to match the executed script. Finally, the query summarizes and returns the executed script name. Note: Depending on your environment and data, you may need to adjust the regex or join conditions.",

In many Linux environments attackers use 'touch' to alter file modification timestamps.

It then projects relevant fields including the file name and folder path where the modification occurred, along with the command line executed and the time of the event. This provides a quick look at which file’s modification timestamp may have been manipulated.",

            "explanation": "The query below first identifies process events where the command line contains the Linux ping command with a high count value (using the '-c' parameter and threshold of 50). These events serve as our ‘delay’ events. Then, for each such event (grouped by DeviceId and the parent process that launched ping), we look for the next process event (based on ProcessCreationTime) that was launched by the same parent. That next process’s command line is what was executed immediately after the ping delay. Adjust the count threshold (currently set to 50) as needed.",
