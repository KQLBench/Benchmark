    "context": "In a Linux environment where system auditing captures file access events, an attacker may attempt to enumerate local password policies by reading configuration files.",
    "objective": "Determine the exact command that was used to view the systemâ€™s password expiration policy on a Linux host.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The access to /etc/login.defs will be logged as a file read event, with the full command recorded in the ProcessCommandLine or InitiatingProcessCommandLine field.",
        "detection_approach": "Search for file access events targeting login.defs in DeviceFileEvents or Syslog, then extract the command line that performed the read action."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Phrase the question to ask which specific command accessed the password policy file, and expect the answer to be the full command string.",
    "prompt": "On a Linux system, logs show that the password expiration settings file was accessed. Identify which command was executed to list its contents.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is 'cat /etc/login.defs'. In the results, we find both a direct execution ('cat /etc/login.defs') and an invocation via bash ('bash -c \"cat /etc/login.defs\"'). This directly matches the detection requirement, so the queried data provides clear evidence for the sought activities.",
