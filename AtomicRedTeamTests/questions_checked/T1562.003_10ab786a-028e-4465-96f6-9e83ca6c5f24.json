    "context": "On a Linux host, an adversary attempted to tamper with Bash history behavior by changing environment variables and clearing the history cache.",

        "command_analysis": "Identify bash process events where the ProcessCommandLine field includes an export of HISTCONTROL and extract the exact command issued.",
