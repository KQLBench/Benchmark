    "context": "On a Windows system, an attacker used the built-in command prompt to perform network reconnaissance by issuing a series of ICMP pings in a loop against a contiguous block of IP addresses.",
    "objective": "Determine the exact command line that was executed to conduct the ping sweep on the 192.168.1.x network.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "We expect to see a cmd.exe process invoking a FOR /L loop combined with ping flags (-n and -w) to iterate through host addresses.",
        "detection_approach": "Query DeviceProcessEvents for entries where ProcessCommandLine contains 'for /l' and 'ping -n 1', then examine the full command to extract the loop parameters and target subnet."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Ask which full command was used so that the analyst hunts for the specific ProcessCommandLine and reports it exactly as seen in the logs.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The returned results include a 'ProcessCommandLine' value that exactly matches the expected command: 'for /l %i in (1,1,254) do ping -n 1 -w 100 192.168.1.%i'. This means the query captured process execution for the specified network scanning activity, directly matching the detection question's requirements.
