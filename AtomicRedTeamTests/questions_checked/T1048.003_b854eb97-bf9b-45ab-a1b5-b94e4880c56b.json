    "context": "Process creation logs on a Windows host reveal PowerShell activity that appears to copy a zip archive to a remote FTP server.",

        "command_analysis": "Inspect ProcessCommandLine entries for commands invoking a binary to upload data over FTP, noting parameters like “copy”, “ftpserver”, and credentials.",
