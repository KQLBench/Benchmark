    "context": "A Linux host has been used to enumerate loaded kernel modules via common utilities. The system’s process execution logs contain entries for these commands.",
    "objective": "Detect when a user or script listed kernel modules and specifically filtered for modules containing the string “vmw” to identify virtualization-related drivers.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The test ran three commands in sequence: one to list modules via lsmod, another via kmod list, and a third that grepped for “vmw” in /proc/modules.",
        "detection_approach": "Search the Linux process execution or syslog tables for events where the shell executed commands matching module enumeration patterns, then isolate the specific grep invocation."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask exactly which command was used to filter kernel modules for vmw entries, and expect the full command string as the answer.",
    "prompt": "Using Linux process execution logs, identify the specific command that was used to filter loaded kernel modules for entries containing “vmw.” What was that full command?",
    "answer": [
        "grep vmw /proc/modules"

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: Among the query results, there is a row with 'ProcessCommandLine' equal to 'grep vmw /proc/modules'. This directly matches the expected answer, confirming that the dataset includes evidence of this activity. Since a 1:1 relationship between expected answer and result is sought, and that entry is present, the results contain the needed information to answer the detection question.",
