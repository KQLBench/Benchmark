    "context": "On Linux hosts, auditd enforces system monitoring by maintaining a set of audit rules. An attacker may run a command to remove all of these rules at once, hindering visibility into subsequent actions.",
    "objective": "Detect when audit rules have been wiped out and pinpoint the exact command used to perform this deletion.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The command “auditctl -D” instructs auditctl to delete every active audit rule, effectively resetting the audit policy.",
        "detection_approach": "Leverage process execution logs (e.g., DeviceProcessEvents or Syslog) to filter for any invocation of “auditctl” where the command line includes the “-D” flag."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Craft a question that directs the analyst to hunt process execution events for the auditctl utility with the deletion flag and capture the full command invocation as the answer.",
    "prompt": "A Linux system’s audit framework appears to have been reset unexpectedly. Search your process execution records to identify which exact invocation removed all auditd rules. What full command was executed?",
    "answer": [
        "auditctl -D"
    ],
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "KQL_query": "DeviceProcessEvents\n| where FileName == \"auditctl\" and ProcessCommandLine contains \"-D\"\n| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ProcessCommandLine\n| sort by TimeGenerated desc",
    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The query results include a record with the 'ProcessCommandLine' field showing 'auditctl -D', which matches the expected answer exactly. This provides clear evidence that the query can detect the execution of 'auditctl -D', as described in the detection question.",
