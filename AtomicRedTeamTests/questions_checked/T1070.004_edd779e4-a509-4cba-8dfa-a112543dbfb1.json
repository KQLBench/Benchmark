    "context": "On a Windows endpoint, a PowerShell command was executed that removed a directory and its contents from the temporary folder.",

    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The test uses the PowerShell Remove-Item cmdlet with a -Recurse flag against a specified folder under %TEMP%, deleting that folder and all its contents.",
        "detection_approach": "Query DeviceProcessEvents for entries where the process command line contains Remove-Item and -Recurse targeting the temp path; extract the initiating process file name to identify the tool used."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask for the name of the process that carried out the deletion. The answer should be the exact process name as seen in the logs.",
