    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The provided query results specifically include a row where the 'ProcessCommandLine' contains 'export HISTSIZE=0', exactly as expected. This indicates that the KQL query has captured the precise activity needed to answer the detection question, with supporting contextual fields (e.g., DeviceName, AccountName) also present. Therefore, these results are sufficient and directly responsive to the detection requirement.",
