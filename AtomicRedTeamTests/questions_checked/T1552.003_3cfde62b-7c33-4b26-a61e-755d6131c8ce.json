    "context": "On a Linux workstation, security monitoring captured a shell command that reads a user’s bash history, filters for sensitive keywords, and redirects the matches into a file.",
    "objective": "Detect when an actor scans the bash history for specific terms and saves the results to a file.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The adversary runs a shell pipeline that cats the .bash_history, applies grep with multiple expressions, and redirects output.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "We need to ask what filename was used as the destination for the filtered history results, expecting an exact match to the tool’s output file.",
    "prompt": "A Linux user’s bash history was searched for patterns like ‘pass’ and ‘ssh’, and the matching lines were redirected into a new file. Determine the name of that file.",

Each row in the query results has the OutputFile value '~/loot.txt\"', which, after trimming potential extraneous quotes, refers directly to 'loot.txt'.
