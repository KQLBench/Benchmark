    "context": "An attacker or administrator on a Windows host lists all volume shadow copies by running a system utility with elevated privileges.",
    "objective": "Detect instances where the Windows built-in tool for managing Volume Shadow Copies is invoked to enumerate existing snapshots.",

        "command_analysis": "The attacker uses vssadmin.exe with the “list shadows” parameter to display all shadow copies.",

The evidence required to verify this command was executed is present in the results, along with relevant metadata (timestamps, device, user, initiator). Therefore, the data required to answer the detection question is present and properly structured.",
