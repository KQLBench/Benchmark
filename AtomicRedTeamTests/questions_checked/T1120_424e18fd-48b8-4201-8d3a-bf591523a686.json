    "context": "An attacker on a Windows host ran a command to enumerate all connected drives in an attempt to discover peripheral devices. Your environment captures process execution events from DeviceProcessEvents.",

        "command_analysis": "The adversary invoked the Windows fsutil tool with the ‘fsinfo drives’ argument.",
