    "context": "On a Linux host, an attacker attempted to cover their tracks by redirecting the bash history file to a black hole.",
    "objective": "Detect processes that linked a userâ€™s bash history to /dev/null to erase their command records.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The adversary used the ln utility with force (-f) and symbolic (-s) flags to create a symlink from the history file to /dev/null.",
        "detection_approach": "Search process creation logs for ln invocations referencing /dev/null and a history file path (e.g., .bash_history)."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "We need to ask about the specific tool used without naming the exact query fields, prompting the analyst to inspect process events where ln is executed against /dev/null.",
    "prompt": "On a Linux system, you suspect someone erased their command history by linking the history file to /dev/null. Investigate process events and determine which utility was executed to achieve this.",

The presence of the 'ln' binary and the actual command executed confirms that the query results provide the evidence required to identify 'ln' activity as expected.",
