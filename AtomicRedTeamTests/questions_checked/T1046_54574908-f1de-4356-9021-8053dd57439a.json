    "context": "On a Windows host, an adversary uses PowerShell to pull down a remote script and immediately launch a scan targeting the MS-RPRN RPC service.",

        "command_analysis": "PowerShell invokes IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...) and then runs a function named spoolvulnscan with flags -noninteractive and -consoleoutput.",
        "detection_approach": "Search process creation logs for PowerShell command lines that include both a remote download via DownloadString and the execution of spoolvulnscan, then extract the function name."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "We want the analyst to pinpoint the exact function used to perform the RPC service scan. The question should ask for the function name, and the answer will be that single identifier.",
    "prompt": "On a Windows endpoint you observe a PowerShell process that fetches a script from the internet and immediately executes an RPC service scan against the spooler. Which function name was invoked to perform that scan?",

The results show a record where the FunctionName is 'spoolvulnscan', and the ProcessCommandLine includes the execution of this function via a powershell script.
