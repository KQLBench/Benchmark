    "context": "On a Windows host, an adversary registered a new service with a name crafted to resemble the legitimate W32Time service but pointing to a custom script.",
    "objective": "Identify the built-in utility used to create the rogue service.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attacker ran a service creation command that specified a service name and a binPath, using the Windows service controller utility.",
        "detection_approach": "Look for DeviceProcessEvents showing execution of the service controller tool with a 'create' operation or registry events indicating a new service key under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Ask which Windows utility was invoked to register the suspicious service, forcing analysis of process execution logs rather than relying on prior knowledge.",
    "prompt": "A threat actor on a Windows system crafted and registered a service named almost identically to the standard time service, but redirecting execution to a custom script. Review the logging data to determine which native command-line tool was used to perform this action. What utility was invoked?",
