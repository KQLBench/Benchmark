    "context": "On Windows systems, a .NET framework install utility is often leveraged by attackers to execute malicious assemblies via its Install method, leaving traces in process creation logs.",
    "objective": "Identify the name of the utility that was invoked to install the .NET assembly.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "Attackers construct a command line using parameters like \"/action=install\" pointing to a compiled DLL; this entire invocation appears in process creation events.",
        "detection_approach": "Search the DeviceProcessEvents table for entries where the ProcessCommandLine contains \"/action=install\" and inspect the FileName or ProcessCommandLine to extract the invoked executable name."

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is 'InstallUtil', which refers to the use of the InstallUtil tool. In the query results, the second row has 'InstallUtil.exe' in the 'FileName' field and the corresponding command line, confirming that activity involving InstallUtil was captured by the query. Therefore, the results provide evidence needed to answer the detection question.",
