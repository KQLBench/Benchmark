    "context": "On a Windows system, an adversary copied the legitimate PowerShell binary into the user’s AppData directory, renamed it to mimic a system component, and executed it from this non-standard location.",
    "objective": "Detect instances where powershell.exe has been masqueraded by copying and renaming it to a familiar Windows process name in an unexpected folder.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attacker ran a command to copy powershell.exe from the System32 directory to the AppData folder and renamed it to taskhostw.exe, then executed the renamed binary.",
        "detection_approach": "Query process creation events for executions of a file named like a Windows system host (e.g., taskhostw.exe) running from a non-standard path; correlate with internal file metadata to confirm it’s actually powershell.exe."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask for the specific filename that was used to impersonate a legitimate system executable. The answer should be the exact name of that masqueraded file.",

The returned log includes a row where 'FileName' is 'taskhostw.exe', directly matching the expected answer.
