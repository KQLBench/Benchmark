    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The query results show a command ('chmod -R 755 /tmp/AtomicRedTeam/atomics/T1222.002') executed by the account 'root' on a target path clearly referencing T1222.002. This directly relates to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1222.002 (Permission Modification), particularly because 'chmod' is used for permission modification and the path references T1222.002. The data therefore contains the necessary evidence to support detection of the expected behavior.",
