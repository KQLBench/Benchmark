    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The 'ProcessCommandLine' field in the results shows the executed command: 'find //.aws -name credentials -type f'. This directly matches the expected answer regarding 'credentials' because it is clear evidence of someone looking for a file named 'credentials' (commonly containing sensitive information).
