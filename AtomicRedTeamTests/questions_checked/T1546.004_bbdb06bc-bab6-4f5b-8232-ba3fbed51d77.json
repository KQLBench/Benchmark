    "context": "On Linux systems, attackers may modify shell startup scripts like ~/.profile to achieve persistence by automatically executing malicious commands at user login.",

        "command_analysis": "Look for file modification events or syslog entries indicating a shell process used output redirection (>>) to append content into a .profile file.",
