        "command_analysis": "The detection will hinge on locating process execution events where reg.exe is invoked with query parameters targeting 'password' entries.",

This contains both expected commands ('reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s' and 'reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s') linked with a command concatenation.
