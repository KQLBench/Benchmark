    "context": "An attacker abused the Windows Event Viewer file association to achieve persistence by modifying a user registry key and creating a scheduled task that launches a payload when MSC files are opened.",
    "objective": "Identify the malicious payload file that was registered under the MSC file association via registry modification.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "A reg add operation altered the default value of HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command to point to the payload binary.",

    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Phrase the question to ask specifically which executable was set in the hacked registry key. The answer should be the file name of that payload.",
    "prompt": "On Windows, review recent registry changes to detect when the MSC file association was hijacked by a reg add operation. What executable file was configured as the default command under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is 'calc.exe'. By analyzing the query results, specifically the 'RegistryValueData' column, there are two records with the value 'c:\\windows\\System32\\calc.exe'. This matches the expected answer. The structure and columns present (TimeGenerated, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName, RegistryValueData) provide enough context to confirm the detection of 'calc.exe' related activity.",
