    "context": "On Windows systems, a simulated BlackByte ransomware test performs a series of registry modifications via PowerShell to prepare the host for lateral movement.",
    "objective": "Detect unauthorized registry changes that align with BlackByte’s “Preparing to Worm” steps by identifying the specific registry value names created.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The PowerShell commands use New-ItemProperty to add three DWORD values under HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System and HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem.",
        "detection_approach": "Query DeviceRegistryEvents for entries where InitiatingProcessFileName is PowerShell, filter RegistryKey paths matching the targeted system and file system policies, and extract RegistryValueName."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask explicitly which registry value names were added by the PowerShell test, and expect the answer to list those exact names.",
    "prompt": "Review registry event logs on the Windows host for PowerShell-driven writes to system policy and file system keys. Which registry value names were created during this BlackByte preparation simulation?",
    "answer": [

The presence of these specific values in the output provides clear evidence needed to identify the activities addressed in the expected answers.
