    "context": "During a simulated post-exploitation scenario on a Windows host, an adversary may use custom executables to establish inter-process communication via named pipes.",
    "objective": "Identify which named pipe tool was executed on the Windows system.",

        "command_analysis": "Look for process creation events where the command line references a named pipe executor executable with a pipe identifier.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The query results include two records. The second record specifically has 'namedpipes_executor.exe' in the 'FileName' column, matching the expected answer. Additionally, the first record's 'ProcessCommandLine' also references 'namedpipes_executor.exe', indicating activity related to this executable. The evidence in these results is sufficient to detect the referenced process.",
