    "context": "On Windows, svchost.exe can store decrypted RDP credentials in memory. An attacker may use PowerShell to locate the svchost process serving RDP (port 3389) then leverage rundll32.exe and comsvcs.dll to create a full memory dump in the temporary folder.",
    "objective": "Detect when a memory dump of svchost.exe is created via rundll32.exe and identify the file’s exact name.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attack script finds the svchost process ID (either from an existing RDP connection or by default) then calls ‘rundll32.exe C:\\windows\\System32\\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <pid> <temp>\\\\svchost-exe.dmp full’.",
        "detection_approach": "Search file creation events for new .dmp files in user Temp directories initiated by rundll32.exe with comsvcs.dll in the command line."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Encourage the analyst to query the file event logs for rundll32.exe creating .dmp files under Temp and extract the file name, rather than simply naming the dump file without evidence.",
    "prompt": "On a Windows host, an attacker leveraged COMSVCS.DLL via rundll32.exe to dump the memory of svchost.exe into a file under the Temp directory. Review the file creation logs to determine the exact name of the dump file that was generated.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is 'svchost-exe.dmp'. In the query results, the 'FileName' field contains 'svchost-exe.dmp', and the 'FolderPath' matches a temp location with the same file. The record also provides context (process and command line) indicating the file was generated. This meets the criteria specified in the expected answer.",
