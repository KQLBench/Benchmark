    "context": "An attacker executed a shell command on a Linux host to enumerate Google Chromium bookmark JSON files across user profiles.",
    "objective": "Detect when someone searches for Chromium’s ‘Bookmarks’ files under .config and redirects the results to disk.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "A sh process runs 'find / -path \"*/.config/chromium/*/Bookmarks\"' and uses echo with output redirection to append each match to an output file.",
        "detection_approach": "Query DeviceProcessEvents for a 'find' invocation targeting '.config/chromium' with command line arguments including 'Bookmarks' and a redirection operator to capture results."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Ask for the exact filename where the list of discovered bookmark files was saved, prompting analysts to pinpoint the redirection target inside the process command line.",
    "prompt": "On Linux, review the process execution logs to uncover when Chromium’s bookmark JSON files were being located and the results persisted. Focus on shell commands that search under .config/chromium and write output to a file. What was the filename used to save the findings?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: Within the 'ProcessCommandLine' fields of multiple results, the output file 'T1217-Chrome.txt' is explicitly mentioned as the destination for collected bookmark paths via the find command.
