    "context": "On a Windows host, an adversary process is suspected of enumerating system environment variables to gather path and configuration details.",
    "objective": "Detect when a built-in Windows command was invoked to list environment variables.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attacker used the native ‘set’ instruction in a Windows command prompt to dump all environment variables.",
        "detection_approach": "Search the DeviceProcessEvents table for cmd.exe invocations whose command line includes the ‘set’ keyword, indicating environment enumeration."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Ask directly which command was executed by reviewing process creation records; the answer must match the exact command as logged.",
    "prompt": "A Windows system shows a cmd.exe process spawn that appears to have been used for environment discovery. Review the process creation records to identify the exact command the adversary ran to enumerate environment variables.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The detection question expected answers related to the usage of the 'set' command, which is evident from the 'ProcessCommandLine' column. Examples include commands such as 'cmd.exe /c set \"SYSTEMROOT=C:\\Windows\\Temp\" ...', 'cmd.exe /c set comspec=%windir%\\System32\\calc.exe ...', and more. There are multiple rows in the results where the 'set' command appears, either alone or as part of a command chain. Thus, these results do provide the information required to answer the detection question, specifically identifying uses of the 'set' command.",
