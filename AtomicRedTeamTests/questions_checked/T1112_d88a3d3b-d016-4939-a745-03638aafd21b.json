The query results show a record with 'RegistryValueData' field explicitly set to 'proxy.atomic-test.com:8080'. This, combined with other supporting fields like 'RegistryValueName' being 'ProxyServer' and process information, provides sufficient evidence to detect the activity described in the expected answers.",
