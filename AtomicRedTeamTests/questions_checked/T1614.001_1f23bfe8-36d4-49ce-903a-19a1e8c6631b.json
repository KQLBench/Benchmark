    "context": "A Windows host where an adversary ran a PowerShell script to enumerate various system configuration settings such as UI language, user language preferences, system locale, current culture, UI culture, and time zone.",
    "objective": "Detect execution of the PowerShell cmdlet used to retrieve the system locale.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The script builds a hash table with entries like UILanguage = Get-WinUILanguageOverride, SystemLocale = Get-WinSystemLocale, CurrentCulture = [System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::CurrentCulture.Name, and then outputs each key-value pair.",
