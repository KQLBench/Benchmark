    "context": "On a Linux system, a test was executed that created a new systemd service unit along with a timer, and subsequently the timer was started and enabled. This corresponds to changes in system configurations recorded in log events that detail systemd actions.",
    "objective": "Investigate the Linux log data to identify evidence of the newly created timer activation and determine the exact name of the systemd timer that was enabled.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "Review the log entries where systemctl commands are executed; focus on distinctions in timer operations.",
        "detection_approach": "Search for log events related to systemd service and timer management to find the unique identifier for the timer."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Determine which newly created systemd timer was activated by analyzing the system logs. The answer must be exactly the timer's name as recorded in the test invocation.",
    "prompt": "Examine the logs from the Linux system for events related to the systemd timer activation. Identify any records indicating that a new timer unit was started and enabled, and determine which timer name was used.",
