    "context": "On Linux systems, critical file permission changes are recorded via Syslog. An elevated shell performed a sequence of commands to set group execution rights and enable the SetGID flag on a target file.",
    "objective": "Detect when a file has had its group ID bit set by an elevated process and identify which file was modified.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The red team test runs 'sudo chmod g+xs <file>' to add both the group execute bit and the SetGID flag to the specified file.",
        "detection_approach": "Search Syslog entries for chmod operations that include the 'g+xs' pattern and extract the filename from the logged message."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to lead the analyst to filter Syslog for permission changes involving 'g+xs', then ask for the file name that had its SetGID bit set.",
    "prompt": "A Linux hostâ€™s Syslog contains records of an elevated shell executing a command that granted group execute rights and enabled the SetGID bit on a file. Investigate the logs and report the name of the file whose group ID bit was modified.",
