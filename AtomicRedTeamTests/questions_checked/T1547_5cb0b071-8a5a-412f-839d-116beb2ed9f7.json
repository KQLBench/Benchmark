    "context": "On a Windows endpoint, a native command-line utility was abused to install a driver without user awareness.",
    "objective": "Detect instances where a system utility is invoked to add or install a driver and identify the specific tool used.",

        "command_analysis": "Look for process creation events where the process name matches a known driver installation utility and command-line arguments include installation flags.",
