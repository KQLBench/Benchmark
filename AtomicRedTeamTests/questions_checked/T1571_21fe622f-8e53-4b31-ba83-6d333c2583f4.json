    "context": "Windows environments support native PowerShell cmdlets for connectivity checks, which can be abused by adversaries to probe uncommon network ports.",

        "command_analysis": "The Test-NetConnection cmdlet is invoked with a specified ComputerName and Port argument, performing a TCP/ICMP probe; the command line includes “-port <number>”.",

This directly corresponds to the expected answer of \"8081\", demonstrating that the port 8081 was tested in these activities.
