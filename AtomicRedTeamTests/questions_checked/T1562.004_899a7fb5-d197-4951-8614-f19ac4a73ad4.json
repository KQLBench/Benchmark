    "context": "On a Linux host, adversaries may quietly remove specific iptables rules rather than disabling the firewall entirely, for example deleting a rule that blocks outbound FTP traffic. Process execution logs capture each command invocation.",
    "objective": "Detect when an iptables rule blocking FTP on the OUTPUT chain has been deleted and identify the exact command used.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "Look for iptables invocations containing the delete flag (-D), the OUTPUT chain, and the FTP port (21) with a DROP target.",
        "detection_approach": "Query process execution records to filter commands where iptables was called to delete a rule on the OUTPUT chain targeting TCP port 21 with DROP."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "The question is phrased to focus the analyst on locating the precise deletion command in execution logs, prompting them to filter for specific iptables arguments.",
    "prompt": "Investigate Linux process execution logs for any use of iptables that removes a rule blocking outbound FTP traffic. What full command was issued to delete this rule?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer 'iptables -D OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP' is present exactly in one of the Query results under the 'ProcessCommandLine' field. In addition, the same command appears within a shell wrapper in the other results. This means that the dataset includes clear evidence of the activity described in the detection question.",
