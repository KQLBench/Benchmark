    "context": "A Windows host has recorded file modification events where the current user’s PowerShell profile was altered. An adversary appended content to that profile to launch a program automatically when PowerShell starts.",
    "objective": "Determine exactly which command was appended to the PowerShell profile to launch the malicious executable.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attack uses PowerShell’s Add-Content cmdlet to insert a Start-Process invocation into the user profile, then exits PowerShell.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "The question should steer the analyst toward examining profile modifications and isolating the newly added process launch statement; the answer is the appended Start-Process command.",

This shows that the PowerShell command to start calc.exe was present in the activity captured by the query.
