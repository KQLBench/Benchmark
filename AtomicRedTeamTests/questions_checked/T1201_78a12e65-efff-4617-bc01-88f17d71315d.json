        "command_analysis": "An actor runs a shell command to display the contents of the password quality configuration file using ‘cat’ against /etc/security/pwquality.conf.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Focus on identifying which configuration file was read based on log entries that show a shell command accessing a file in /etc/security.",
    "prompt": "You are reviewing Linux syslog records on a CentOS/RHEL 7.x server. You notice entries for shell commands that access system configuration files under /etc/security. Determine exactly which configuration file was being inspected by the command.",
