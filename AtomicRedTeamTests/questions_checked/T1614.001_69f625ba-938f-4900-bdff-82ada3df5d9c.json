    "context": "On Windows systems, DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) can be invoked with elevated privileges to enumerate international settings. Adversaries may abuse this legitimate tool to fingerprint system locales.",
    "objective": "Identify when DISM was executed to query system language settings and surface the exact command used.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The dism.exe binary is launched with the /online and /Get-Intl flags to list locale information.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Phrase the question to ask specifically what full command invocation was used to retrieve language information, and expect the answer to match the exact dism.exe invocation recorded in the logs.",
    "prompt": "In a Windows environment, locate any occurrences where an elevated DISM utility was run to enumerate the systemâ€™s international (locale) settings. What was the exact command line used?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer was the command 'dism.exe /online /Get-Intl'. The results include two rows where 'DetectedCommand' is 'dism.exe  /online /Get-Intl' (with a double space) and 'dism.exe /online /Get-Intl' (single space). Both strings indicate that this command was executed, confirming the presence of this activity. The evidence in the results matches the detection question fully.",
