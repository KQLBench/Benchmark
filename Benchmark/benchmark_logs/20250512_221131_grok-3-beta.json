It searches the DeviceProcessEvents table for process creation events where the filename is 'arp.exe' and the command line arguments include '-a', which is the typical switch for displaying ARP cache entries. I have also included a case-insensitive search for 'arp' in the command line to catch variations. Additionally, the query projects relevant fields such as the timestamp, device name, exact command line used, process creation time, and the account details of the user who executed the command. The results are ordered by timestamp in descending order for the most recent events first. This approach broadens the search to ensure we capture relevant events even if the command syntax varies slightly.",

            "explanation": "This KQL query is designed to identify PowerShell processes on a Windows endpoint that download scripts from the internet and subsequently perform an RPC service scan against the spooler service. The query focuses on two main tables: DeviceProcessEvents to detect PowerShell execution with web-related commands, and DeviceNetworkEvents to detect network activity targeting port 445 (commonly associated with SMB and spooler services) or RPC-related activity. The query joins these tables based on DeviceId and InitiatingProcessId to correlate the PowerShell process with network activity within a 10-minute window to account for potential delays. It extracts potential function names from the PowerShell command line using a regex pattern that matches common PowerShell cmdlets like 'Invoke-*' or 'Test-*'. To optimize performance and avoid returning too many results or no results, the query uses a broader time window and avoids overly restrictive filters initially. It also summarizes the results to show the earliest occurrence of each function name per device, limiting the output to the top 50 results sorted by timestamp for manageability. The focus on SMB port 445 and explicit spooler or RPC references ensures relevance to the spooler scan behavior.",

It returns the device name, process name, exact command line used, and the timestamp of the event. Results are ordered by time to show the most recent activities first.

The query focuses on the DeviceProcessEvents table, filtering for processes related to shell environments like 'bash', 'sh', or 'zsh'. It uses the 'has_any' operator to search for command line patterns that might indicate history clearing, such as redirecting from /dev/null, echoing empty strings, truncating, or removing the .bash_history file. The query joins with DeviceInfo to ensure the results are limited to Linux devices.

I've also added a stricter filter to ensure matches are more relevant by using 'has' instead of 'has_any' to avoid partial matches that could return unrelated results.

It focuses on the DeviceProcessEvents table, which contains information about processes executed on devices. The query filters for processes where the command line or file name suggests the use of Tor, a common service for onion routing. It specifically looks for instances of 'tor' in the ProcessCommandLine or FileName fields. Additionally, it joins with the DeviceInfo table to ensure the operating system is Linux, as specified in the query requirement. The results include the DeviceName, FileName (likely the service name), ProcessCommandLine, and the timestamp of the process creation for context. The query limits the results to 10 for brevity and sorts them by timestamp in descending order to show the most recent events first.",

            "explanation": "This KQL query targets the scenario where an attacker with elevated rights attempted to delete backup files on a Windows system, resulting in 'access denied' errors. The query focuses on the DeviceFileEvents table, filtering for file deletion actions (FileDeleted or FileDeleteAttempted) on the C: drive. It looks for common backup file extensions (.bak, .bkp, .backup, .bck, .old) in the FileName field using a case-insensitive ends-with condition. Additionally, it checks for 'Access Denied' or 'Permission Denied' messages in the AdditionalFields to identify failed attempts due to permissions. Since previous attempts returned no results, I've expanded the query to also consider DeviceProcessEvents to capture command line activity related to deletion commands (like 'del' or 'rmdir') that might indicate the attacker's actions, even if the file deletion events themselves are not logged. I also removed the strict filter on InitiatingProcessTokenElevation to broaden the search. The query unions results from both tables to provide a comprehensive view of the attacker's command line activity. Results are ordered by Timestamp in descending order to show the most recent events first.",

            "explanation": "This KQL query focuses on investigating registry events related to Active Setup entries under Internet Explorer Core Fonts on a Windows endpoint. The query targets the 'DeviceRegistryEvents' table, filtering for registry keys related to Active Setup Installed Components. I have broadened the search by using 'contains' for partial matches on the registry key path to ensure we capture variations of the key related to Internet Explorer or Core Fonts. The query specifically looks for modifications to the 'StubPath' value, which is likely where the payload is set. It projects relevant fields such as the device name, timestamp, registry key, value data (which should contain the payload), and details about the initiating process for context. The results are ordered by timestamp in descending order to show the most recent events first. This revised query should address the issue of no results by using a less restrictive filter on the registry key path.",

The results include the exact command line added or modified (if available in the event), along with relevant details such as DeviceName, AccountName, and Timestamp for context.

It focuses on DeviceProcessEvents to find PowerShell executions with commands indicating web requests or credential access. It then joins with DeviceFileEvents to correlate downloaded .ps1 files from remote URLs within a tight time window of the process execution. Additionally, it joins with DeviceNetworkEvents to capture network activity related to PowerShell accessing remote URLs. The query filters for relevant command line keywords, ensures proper time correlation between events, and projects key details like device name, command line, script name, and URLs for investigation.

Additionally, it correlates with DeviceNetworkEvents to detect network activity related to LLMNR/NBNS spoofing by looking for traffic on ports commonly associated with these protocols (UDP 5355 for LLMNR and UDP 137 for NBNS).

The query looks for relevant keywords like '.NET', 'COMPlus_', or 'Trace' in the registry key or value name to filter for .NET tracing-related changes. Additionally, it checks if the RegistryValueData is set to '0' or empty, which could indicate that tracing was disabled. The query also includes the initiating process details to identify the command-line tool used (e.g., 'reg.exe' or similar tools). Results are ordered by timestamp in descending order to show the most recent changes first.

The query focuses on file events from the 'DeviceFileEvents' table, filtering for actions related to file creation and renaming within the last 30 days. It specifically looks for events involving the Print Spooler service (spoolsv.exe) or files with 'spool' in their name located in the 'Windows\\System32' directory, which is a common target for such hijacks. The query uses a self-join to correlate file creation events with subsequent rename events, ensuring that only files moved from their original locations are considered. The results are ordered by timestamp to identify the earliest relevant event, and limited to the first occurrence for clarity.",
