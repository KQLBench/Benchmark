    "context": "In a Windows environment, an attacker uses PowerShell to interact with WMIâ€™s PS_ScheduledTask class and import an XML definition to create a new scheduled task upon user login.",
    "objective": "Detect creation of a scheduled task via WMI Invoke-CimMethod using an XML import.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The malicious command reads an XML file then calls Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName PS_ScheduledTask -NameSpace 'Root\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\TaskScheduler' -MethodName RegisterByXml, passing the XML to register the task.",
        "detection_approach": "Search process creation logs for PowerShell invocations containing Invoke-CimMethod with PS_ScheduledTask and RegisterByXml, then extract the XML filename from the command line."

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question around uncovering the specific XML file used in the WMI-based task registration, ensuring the analyst queries process logs and parses command-line arguments.",
    "prompt": "Investigate Windows process events for PowerShell activity that leverages WMI to register a scheduled task via XML import. What was the name of the XML file supplied to the RegisterByXml method?",
    "answer": [

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The query results contain a row where the XmlFile field explicitly identifies \"T1053_005_WMI.xml\" as being read and used in a PowerShell command to register a scheduled task via WMI, which directly addresses the detection question concerning T1053_005_WMI.xml activity.
