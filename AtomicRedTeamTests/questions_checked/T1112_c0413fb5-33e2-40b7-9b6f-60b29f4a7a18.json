    "context": "An adversary on a Windows system has executed a registry modification to enable storage of cleartext logon credentials by changing an entry under the WDigest key. This action is logged in the registry event logs.",

Additionally, the command lines in the results demonstrate the modification of the 'UseLogonCredential' registry value, which is exactly the information needed to answer the detection question about changes to this setting.",
