    "context": "An adversary used a Windows command prompt to search across all user profiles for browser bookmark files on a compromised host.",

    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask specifically which command-line utility was invoked for the bookmarks enumeration. The answer must match the exact tool name from the logs.",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is 'where', indicating the detection question is likely about identifying the usage of the 'where' utility.
