    "context": "In a Windows environment, attackers may conceal user accounts by manipulating registry entries under the Winlogon SpecialAccounts UserList key.",
    "objective": "Detect when an adversary adds or modifies a registry value to hide a user from the logon screen and determine which account was hidden.",
    "technical_details": {
        "command_analysis": "The attack sequence uses NET USER to create a new account (suffixing the name with a dollar sign) and then issues REG ADD against HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList, setting the value of the new account to 0.",
        "detection_approach": "Inspect DeviceRegistryEvents for registry additions or modifications where RegistryKey ends with SpecialAccounts\\\\UserList and RegistryValueData equals 0 to pinpoint hidden accounts."
    },
    "thinking_how_to_phrase_question_and_answer": "Frame the question to ask specifically which registry value name (the account name) was set to hide an account.",
    "prompt": "On Windows systems, identify any user account that was hidden by setting its value to 0 under the SpecialAccounts\\\\UserList registry key. What was the name of the hidden account?",

    "KQL_validation_message": "KQL query validation successful: The expected answer is 'AtomicOperator$'. In the query results, the field 'RegistryValueName' in the only row present exactly matches 'AtomicOperator$', which satisfies the requirement. The associated fields (process name, command line, etc.) provide context, but for the specific expected answer, the presence of 'AtomicOperator$' in the results is sufficient to confirm that the detection is covered.",
